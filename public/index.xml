      <description>In this section you are going to configure the Mongo database for use with the application. Specifically you are going to add a username and password (tasks for both) for the application database (also called tasks). You&amp;rsquo;ll do all this using the Mongo client from the Lightsail command line.
The following steps are performed from the MEAN instance command line using either your own SSH client or Lightsail&amp;rsquo;s web-based SSH access.</description>

      <description>Next you are going to create the web front end instance. To build the front end instance you will start with the Lightsail Node.js blueprint and add in the application code from GitHub. Additionally the isntance will use a process manager, PM2, to ensure that our application starts up automatically.
Check out the website to learn more about PM2.
 From the Lightsail console home page click Create Instance
