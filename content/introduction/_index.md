### What is Lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started in the cloud. Lightsail provides compute, storage, and networking at a low fixed price. But, it doesn't stop there, your Lightsail instances are built on and can leverage the power of the rest of services that AWS offers. This means that you can start building more quickly than ever before, but are not limited in what you can do long term. 

### Labs Offered

#### Deploy and Scale a MEAN stack application on Amazon Lightsail
This set of labs deals with deploying a MEAN stack application on Amazon Lightsail. In the first part you will use a preconfigured Lightsrail blue print to deploy a Node/Express front end that connects to a MongoDB database running on the same instance. In the second lab you will separate the database from the web front end, and then scale and deploy the front end behind a Lightsail load balancer. 


#### Deploy and Scale a LAMP stack application on Amazon Lightsail
In these labs you will deploy a scalable fault tolerant LAMP stack application. To start off both the PHP front-end and the MySQL database will be deployed into a single Lightsail instance based on the Bitnami LAMP blueprint. Next you'll deploy a highly-available Lightsail managed database, and redirect the web front-end to use it. Finally you'll use Lightsail snapshots to scale the PHP front end, and place those instances behind a load balancer.
